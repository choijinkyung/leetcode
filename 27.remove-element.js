 *
 * Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of
 * val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return
 * the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
 * 
 * Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to
 * get accepted, you need to do the following things:
 * 
 * 
 * Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the
 * elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not
 * important as well as the size of nums.
 * Return k.
 * 
 * 
 * Custom Judge:
 * 
 * The judge will test your solution with the following code:
 * 
 * 
 * int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
 * int val = ...; // Value to remove
 * int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
 * ⁠                           // It is sorted with no values equaling val.
 * 
 * int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation
 * 
 * assert k == expectedNums.length;
 * sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
 * for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
 * ⁠   assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
 * Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
 * Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements
 * of nums being 2.
 * It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are
 * underscores).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
 * Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
 * Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements
 * of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
 * Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
 * It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are
 * underscores).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= nums.length <= 100
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 50
 * 0 <= val <= 100
 *
